It looks like there's an error in your calculation. Let's verify the multiplication step by step:

1. Break 324 into parts: 300, 20, and 4.
2. Multiply each part by 234:
  • 234 × 300 = 70,200  
  • 234 × 20 = 4,680  
  • 234 × 4 = 936
3. Now add these three products:
  70,200 + 4,680 = 74,880  
  74,880 + 936 = 75,816

So, the correct result is 234 × 324 = 75,816.
